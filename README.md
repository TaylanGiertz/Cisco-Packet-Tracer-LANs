# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Projects

## This repository showcases my work on designing and simulating Local Area Networks (LANs) using Cisco Packet Tracer. Below are the details of the two projects I completed as part of this exercise.

## 1. Logical Network Diagram
Topology:
   - Router: R01 (Internet Gateway)
   - Unmanaged Switch: S01
   - Managed Switch: S02
   - Devices:  <br/>
    - 2 Laptops (connected to S01)
      <br/>
    - 3 PCs (connected to S02)
      <br/>
    - 1 Network Printer (connected to S02)
    <br/>

## 2. Physical Network Diagram
Topology:
   - Router: R01 (Internet Gateway)
   - Unmanaged Switch: S01
   - Managed Switch: S02
   - Devices:
     - 2 Laptops (connected to S01, on one subnet)
     - 3 PCs (connected to S02, on a different subnet)
     - 1 Network Printer (connected to S02, on the same subnet as PCs) <br/>
